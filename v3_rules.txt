Below are the rules of Connect 4:
1. Players take turns dropping one token into the grid on a vertical board
with six rows and seven columns.
2. Each player has their own style of token.
3. The first player to get four of these tokens in a row, either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, wins. Other configurations, like squares, don't
count as winning combinations.
4. When a player drops a token, it goes to the lowest available space in the
column.
5. If the board is filled without a player getting four in a row, the game
ends in a draw.
